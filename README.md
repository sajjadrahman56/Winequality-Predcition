# Winequality-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using an **ElasticNet** model, which is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. The project is designed to showcase an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using an **ElasticNet** model, which is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. The project is designed to showcase an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Workflow Breakdown

<details>
  <summary>1. Data Ingestion</summary>
  In this step, we load the wine dataset, which includes attributes such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, alcohol content, and more. This dataset is ingested into the pipeline for further processing. The data is sourced from the Wine Quality dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

<details>
  <summary>2. Data Validation</summary>
  Once the data is ingested, it undergoes validation to check for consistency and accuracy. We assess for missing values, duplicate entries, and ensure that the data types are correctly set. This step ensures that the dataset is clean and reliable for further analysis.

### 1. Data Ingestion
In this step, we load the wine dataset, which includes attributes such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, alcohol content, and more. This dataset is ingested into the pipeline for further processing. The data is sourced from the Wine Quality dataset available on UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

### 2. Data Validation
Once the data is ingested, it undergoes validation to check for consistency and accuracy. We assess for missing values, duplicate entries, and ensure that the data types are correctly set. This step ensures that the dataset is clean and reliable for further analysis.

### 3. Data Transformation
Here, we preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for the machine learning model. This includes:
- **Normalization**: Scaling numeric features to bring them to a similar range.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features if necessary, or removing irrelevant ones.
- **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

### 4. Model: ElasticNet Regression
We utilize the **ElasticNet** model for predicting wine quality. ElasticNet is chosen due to its ability to handle multicollinearity and perform both feature selection and regularization. This model is a hybrid of Lasso and Ridge regression:
- **L1 (Lasso)**: Helps in feature selection by adding a penalty on the absolute value of coefficients.
- **L2 (Ridge)**: Shrinks coefficients by adding a penalty on the square of coefficients to avoid overfitting.

The model is trained on the preprocessed data and its performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.

### 5. Model Evaluation
The performance of the ElasticNet model is evaluated on the test set. Various metrics such as **MSE**, **R²**, and **Cross-Validation Score** are reported to analyze the model’s predictive power. Hyperparameter tuning using **Grid Search** or **Random Search** is performed to optimize model parameters such as the alpha value for regularization.

### 6. Deployment (Optional)
The trained model is saved using joblib or pickle and can be deployed into a production environment. For demonstration purposes, a simple **Flask** or **Streamlit** web app can be developed to allow users to input new wine characteristics and predict its quality.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline implementation, demonstrating all the necessary steps to successfully build, train, and evaluate a predictive model for wine quality classification. The ElasticNet model provides a robust solution that balances between model simplicity and accuracy, especially in scenarios where feature selection and regularization are critical.
